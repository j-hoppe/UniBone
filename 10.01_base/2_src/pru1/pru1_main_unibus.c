 28-mar-2019  JH      split off from "all-function" main
 12-nov-2018  JH      entered beta phase

 Master and slave functionality for UNIBUS devices.
 Assumes a physical PDP-11 CPU is working as Arbitrator for
 NPR/NG/SACK and BR/BG/SACK.
 Needed if UniBone runs in a system running PDP-11 CPU
 and simulated or physical devices do DMA or INTR.

 Separated from "all-function" main() because of PRU code size limits.
 Application has to load this into PRU1 depending on system state.

 Test GPIO, shared mem and interrupt
 a) waits until ARM writes a value to mailbox.arm2pru_req
 b) ACKs the value in mailbox.arm2pru_resp, clears arm2pru_req
 c) toggles 1 mio times GPIO, with delay as set by ARM
 d) signal EVENT0
 e) goto a
